## Install gnparser

The command line tool written in Go, gnparser, is required to use this
package.

If you want to install gnparser on your own, instructions can be found
at the gnparser repo (<https://github.com/gnames/gnparser>)

There is a helper function in **rgnparser** for downloading and
installing gnparser on major operating systems (macOS, Windows, Linux):

``` r
rgnparser::install_gnparser()
```

It installs the latest gnparser version by default, but you can specify
which version to install. You can also install gnparser outside of R
yourself (see above).
